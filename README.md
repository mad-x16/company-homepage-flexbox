## COMPANY HOMEPAGE WITH FLEXBOX

This is my attempt as a practice to create a company homepage in HTML and CSS with flexbox (flexible box).
The purpose of the flexbox is to re-arrange elements inside the container element (such as div) without the use of float or positioning when the screen size is adjusted.
Therefore, it could be a part of a responsive website.

To get started, I use ChatGPT to suggest me a mock-up company so that I could use it for this practice. The suggested result was a company called Playspot that is specializes in sports venue booking. 
The scheme color suggested were main (Electric Blue #007BFF / Sunset Orange #FF5733), seconday & accent (Cool Gray #F0F2F5 or #6C757D / Charcoal Black #333333 / White #FFFFFF) colors.

Note that this exercise is intended to create a homepage layout. Other site pages may be included at a later time or...never (In case I forgot or continue to create a complete website).

## SUB-DESCRIPTION
I just want to test out commit changes in local machine and upload to online github repository
